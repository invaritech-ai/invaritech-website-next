# INVARITECH - LLM Context

> INVARITECH delivers drop-in, governed AI automation for enterprise teams.
> In 30 days, we ship one production-grade automation on top of your existing systems with measurable before/after impact.

## About

INVARITECH layers intelligence onto the infrastructure you already own (ERP/CRM/internal tools) instead of replacing systems of record.
We build with enterprise-grade controls: permissions, audit logs, fallbacks, and rollback.

## Core Services

- **30-Day Drop-In AI Automation Sprint**: One bottleneck, one governed build, one measurable delta
- **Workflow Automation**: Reduce handoffs, exceptions, and reconciliation drag
- **AI Integrations**: Connect systems of record through reliable pipelines and approvals
- **Governed Enterprise Chat**: Permissioned access, traceability, operating model
- **GenAI Backend Engineering**: Orchestration, evaluation, observability, latency and cost control

## Featured Projects

### EUDR Compliance Bridge
Built a Python FastAPI bridge and database around a SOAP-based EU backend, 
enabling a small French operator to submit thousands of Due Diligence Statements 
through a simple REST API and dashboard.

**Tech Stack**: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SOAP

## Team

- **Avishek Majumder** (CEO & Co-founder): Data engineer and scientist who has spent his career building and deploying predictive systems in regulated, high-stakes environments across energy and finance. At Invaritech, he designs the automation architectures that let lean teams operate with enterprise-grade reliability.

- **Aditi Garg** (Director & Founder): Solutions and customer success leader who has helped organisations like Goldman Sachs, Uber, BMW and Citi Bank get real value from complex platforms. As VP of Central Support at Trilogy Ltd and Director at Invaritech, she specialises in turning messy support operations into measurable, automated, high-NPS experiences.

## Technology Focus

- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI), Node.js, PostgreSQL, REST/SOAP APIs
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Integration**: ERP/CRM/helpdesk/internal APIs, webhooks, approvals
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud deployment, monitoring, retries/queues, audit logging

## Business Model

Primary engagement: a fixed-scope 30-day sprint:
1. Identify one bottleneck and lock a baseline
2. Build a governed AI automation on top of your existing stack
3. Harden for production (access control, logs, fallbacks, rollback)
4. Deploy + validate before/after + handover

## Verification Policy

INVARITECH distinguishes between "Verified" and "Modeled" results in all public communications:

- **Verified Results**: Outcomes measured post-launch on client systems with ≥30 days of production volume.
- **Modeled Estimates**: Projections based on client-provided data, industry benchmarks for task duration, and standard hourly rates. These are explicitly labeled as "Modeled Estimates" or marked with an asterisk (*).

## Modeling Methodology

When estimating impact for unlaunched projects, we use the following formula:
`Hours saved = (Monthly cases × minutes saved per case ÷ 60) × (1 - automation friction)`
`Cost avoidance = Hours saved × Standard FTE fully loaded hourly rate`

We typically assume:
- 15% rework rate (automation friction) for manual drafting tasks
- 90% time reduction for search/retrieval tasks
- 70% reduction for complex drafting tasks

Implementation details (lib/assessment-calculator.ts):
- Workflow-specific savings: knowledge=0.90, drafting=0.70, intake/finance/other=0.60
- Automation friction: 0.15 for drafting workflows, 0.05 for knowledge retrieval
- standardFteHourlyRate: configurable (default $65)
