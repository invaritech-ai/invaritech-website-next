Day Cycle

## Core Thesis: Layered Intelligence

Most AI projects fail because they start by replacing systems of record.
We do the opposite:
- Keep your stack intact.
- Add an intelligence layer where it creates measurable leverage.
- Govern it like production software: permissions, logs, fallbacks, rollback.
Start with AI PoC development services  to validate one measurable wedge on top of your existing stack, without replatforming. If you need a lower-friction entry point with strict governance, deploy AI chatbot development services  as the interface: permissioned, auditable, and cost-controlled. Once ROI is proven, expand with workflow automation consulting services  and AI integration services  to operationalize the system across teams and systems of record. When scale is the constraint, implement generative AI development services  and AI automation consulting services  to harden architecture, control unit cost, and protect margins.
We do not burn money on AI where simpler systems work better.
## The Invaritech Method

Define the ROI wedge: one workflow, one owner, one baseline, one acceptance criteria.

Ship a working pilot under real constraints with governance built in.

Turn the pilot into durable production: automation across teams, integrations across systems, governed assistants, and GenAI backend engineering.

See If You Qualify

See Work / Results

Limited capacity. Best fit if we can start within 2 weeks.
Ideal for: COOs, CTOs, Heads of Product, Ops leaders
### Built For Production

- Access control & audit logs
- Deterministic fallbacks
- Measurable impact (before/after)
- Runbook & handover

## The &quot;Week 2&quot; Reality

The Sprint is capped at 30 days provided these prerequisites are met.

If blocked, we tell you immediately. We re-scope or stop. No burn.
## Who It’s For

These AI PoC development services are built for teams with real workflows, real data, and real owners.
- Teams with real workflows (not toy demos)
- Production data and real stakeholders
- Tried internal AI experiments that never reached production
- Bought tools but still rely on manual coordination
- Paid vendors who missed deadlines
- Need execution, not another AI strategy deck

&ldquo;If engagement cannot begin within 2 weeks, this is not a fit.&rdquo;
### Not A Fit If

- You want a “magic bullet” to fix every organizational problem at once
- Your primary goal is to replace humans rather than scale their output
- You believe a production-grade system can be built over a weekend
- You want open-ended AI without explicit constraints and approvals

### Typical Triggers

### CEO
We need a new angle shipped.

### COO
Improve throughput without retraining the org.

### CFO
Reduce cost-to-serve with accountability.

### CTO
Turn AI noise into a controlled production system.

## What You Get

By Day 30, you have production-grade behavior. Not a sandbox toy.
### Working Pilot
Deployment-ready automation tied to one bottleneck.

### Measurement Plan
Baseline vs Actuals: time, errors, throughput, cost.

### Controlled Integration
Works with your existing systems. No replatforming.

### Guardrails
Permissions, approvals, logs, fallbacks, rollback.

### Handover
Runbook, operating guidance, next-step roadmap.

## Governance & Guardrails

We don’t ship open-ended “autonomous agents” to make business-critical decisions. We build the engine. You keep the steering wheel.
- System-altering actions require explicit human approval
- Role-based access control, least-privilege permissions, and clear ownership
- Audit logs and traceability across prompts, tools, and outcomes
- Deterministic fallbacks and rollback paths when the model is uncertain

Outcome: production-grade behavior your team can operate and trust, not a demo that collapses under real constraints.
## Real Bottlenecks We Fix

### Automating high-ticket sales ops
Measured on: cycle time, throughput, owner hours reclaimed
- CRM ↔ WhatsApp ↔ scheduling handoffs
- Manual document/receipt generation
- Status hidden across tools

### AI for financial reconciliation
Measured on: reconciliation lag, exception rate, review hours
- Email-driven intake
- Missing tagging/categorization
- Manual reconciliation + approvals

### Reducing support costs
Measured on: time-to-answer, escalation rate, QA rework
- Scattered knowledge sources
- Inconsistent answers
- Escalations for routine questions

## Stack Compatibility

We ship on top of your existing stack. We don’t ask you to replatform.
- AWS
- Azure
- GCP
- Postgres
- SQL
- ERP
- CRM
- Helpdesk
- Internal APIs
- Webhooks

No-go:

Closed platforms with no API, legacy on-prem with no gateway, or black-box data access.

£8k – £12k
For a tightly scoped wedge
## FAQ

### Is this just an AI discovery workshop?
It starts with an AI discovery workshop, but it ends in build and measurable validation.

### Do you build “AI strategy”?
Yes, but only when strategy is the shortest path to safe execution.

### What if we need more than 30 days?
Then this becomes phase 1 of a delivery track. The goal is to prove value first.

### Will our team be involved?
Yes. We define owners, approvals, and operating boundaries from day one.

### What do you need from us?
A workflow owner, system access by Day 3, and enough data to baseline and validate outcomes.

# AI AUTOMATION <br/>CONSULTING

Consulting for leadership teams who need clarity before committing capital.
Our AI automation consulting services for businesses are designed for teams that need execution clarity, not inspiration.
We identify the highest-ROI workflow wedge, define governance boundaries, and produce a build-ready execution plan. Unlike other AI automation consulting firms, we do not stop at strategy.
If you’re evaluating AI process automation consulting, the output should be a build-ready spec tied to measurable outcomes, not a deck of ideas.
We provide AI and automation consulting for businesses that need infrastructure-level discipline, including AI infrastructure automation consulting when reliability and ownership matter.
&ldquo;If AI cannot be tied to a measurable operational objective, it should not be funded.&rdquo;
### Authority

We work with companies prepared to act on the outcome — not workshop it indefinitely.

## Execution-First Deliverables

We do not generate idea lists or innovation roadmaps. We deliver build-ready specifications.
### Ranked Opportunities
ROI + feasibility ranking for your AI automation initiatives.

### Margin Framing
Cost-to-serve analysis: what moves, and by how much.

### Governance Model
RBAC, approvals, and escalation paths defined clearly.

### Risk Assessment
Data boundaries and integration risk evaluation.

### Architecture Advice
Build vs Buy vs Integrate recommendations for your stack.

### Execution Spec
Sprint-ready specification with acceptance criteria and success metrics.

Outcome: Something your CTO can build, COO can own, and CEO can approve.
## Why Most AI Automation Consulting Fails

Strategy without execution is cost without return. Most AI automation consulting stops at recommendations.
#### The Standard Fluff

- 40-slide decks
- High-level maps
- Generic playbooks
#### Our Production Path

- Delivery-first spec
- Accountable ROI
- Bounded execution
We design consulting to end where execution begins.
## When to Choose Consulting

If scope is already clear, go straight to the Sprint. Choose consulting when you need clarity first.
Compare with the Sprint

- Multiple automation ideas but no prioritization
- Compliance or security is blocking implementation
- Stakeholders disagree on success criteria
- You need risk classification before building
- You’re unsure whether AI is even appropriate

Non-Negotiable

## Governance First

Governance is not a compliance checkbox. It is a margin and reputation control system. AI automation consulting without governance is irresponsible.
### Tolerance Levels
Assist vs recommend vs execute boundaries.

### Data Exposure
Strict boundaries for model training and access.

### Fallbacks
Deterministic patterns for when models fail.

### Audit Logs
Comprehensive logging and audit requirements.

### Cost Guardrails
Hard budget limits before hitting scale.

### Reputation Control
Ensuring brand safety in every automated step.

## The Path to Production

### Identify the Wedge
Pick the one workflow where friction and fatigue are highest.

### Baseline the Cost
Time, errors, cycle time, SLA, and cost-to-serve.

### Design the Boundaries
Governance, approvals, data exposure, and safe failure modes.

### Choose the Path
Build vs buy vs integrate, based on your constraints.

### Deliver the Spec
Build-ready plan with acceptance criteria and a Sprint track.

## FAQ

### Do you provide AI automation consulting services only, or implementation too?
Both. Consulting defines the path. The Sprint executes it.

### How are you different from other AI automation consulting firms?
Unlike other AI automation consulting firms, we do not stop at strategy. Every engagement produces a build-ready specification tied to measurable outcomes.

### Will you recommend not using AI?
Yes. If deterministic automation or process redesign wins, we’ll say so.

### Do you work with enterprises or mid-sized businesses?
We work with leadership teams serious about execution, regardless of size.

### Are you an AI automation consulting company or a delivery team?
We are not a generic AI automation consulting company. We’re not one of the AI automation consulting companies that stops at slideware. We’re a delivery-first team. Consulting exists to de-risk execution, not to extend advisory.

# WORKFLOW AUTOMATION <br/>CONSULTING SERVICES (AI-Enabled)

Workflow automation consulting services that turn operational friction into operational liquidity.
Our workflow automation consulting services combine deterministic process automation services with selective AI workflow automation services. We do AI workflow automation consulting when it improves throughput, and we deploy process automation services (including intelligent process automation services and business process automation services) when the safer win is simply removing handoffs, approvals, and reconciliation drag.
We don’t sell the “magic bullet” of total human replacement. We build governed systems that remove the fatigue tax: the repetitive, high-friction work that silently caps throughput.
One audited pipeline. No agentic havoc. Scalability by design.
### Ideally Suited For

Teams moving from prototype thinking to production reality. Best for COOs and Ops leaders who need to scale without linearity.
Request a Workflow Diagnostic

## The Scalability Manifesto

We’re passionate about plugging scalability leaks. Human time is too valuable to waste on reconciliation, data entry, and chasing status updates.
### Computers don’t feel fatigue
Reliability is the natural byproduct of letting systems handle the repetitive 90%.

### Scale should be non-linear
You shouldn’t have to double headcount just to double throughput.

### Top-line focus
We automate the boring so experts spend their 40 hours on high-value work.

## The Governance Gap

Why “no-code automation” often breaks at scale.
When people hear “workflow automation services,” they picture a messy tangle of hidden logic: 400 disconnected automations, no owner, and no audit trail.
#### The &ldquo;Messy Tangle&rdquo;

Legacy automation often means silent failures, unknown errors, and debugging nightmares.
### We Build Visibility-First:

- Clear ownership per step
- Explicit error-handling paths
- Audit logs you can trust
- Deterministic rules for critical actions

If a step fails, you know why in seconds, not hours.
## Our “No-Guess” Architecture

Most AI agencies rely on probability and hope. We rely on governance. We separate work by risk using a clear architectural boundary.
Layer

What it does

How it behaves

Safety rule

Reading (Probabilistic)

Extraction, classification, summarization, triage

AI interprets messy inputs; confidence can inform review

Low-confidence flags a human

Writing (Deterministic)

Database writes, financial syncs, external actions

Hard-coded rules + API integrity + approvals

Human-in-the-loop or strict logic

Confidence scores can inform insights. They do not authorize operations.
## Finance + Ops Workflows (Audited & Governed)

### High-Stakes Financial Intake

#### Before

Email-driven chaos, manual extraction, reconciliation drift.
#### After

Extraction + validation → deterministic matching → human approval gate.
Result: reduced reconciliation lag, fewer expensive exceptions, full auditability.
### Scaling High-Ticket Operations

#### Before

Response times vary by staff fatigue; manual CRM entry causes downstream errors.
#### After

Automated triage + data enrichment → human-led final comms and approvals.
Result: higher throughput capacity without a hiring spree.
Safety First

## The “Anti-Havoc” Guardrails

We don’t gamble with company secrets or public reputation. Every automation includes strict safety protocols.
#### Deterministic Fallbacks

If a model fails or follows an improbable path, the system enters a safe state and alerts a human.
#### Token Discipline

We optimize cost vs performance; no endless agent loops burning your budget.
#### Auditability

Every decision, AI or human, is logged. You get visibility you can trust.
## How We Work

### Isolate the Wedge
Identify the one bottleneck where fatigue and exceptions are highest.

### Baseline the Leak
Quantify cycle time, error rate, reconciliation lag, and cost-to-serve.

### Map the Architecture
Define Reading vs Writing boundaries (and approval gates).

### Deploy First Pipeline
Ship the wedge with logs, fallbacks, and rollback.

### Scale the Engine
Expand once ROI is proven and the operating model is stable.

## FAQ

### Do you promise to replace employees?
No. We promise to make them more effective. We build for scale, not headcount reduction.

### What if the AI makes a mistake?
Business-critical actions never run on guesses. If the AI is unsure, the system stops, falls back, or requests human approval.

### Is this just “intelligent process automation” or RPA?
It can include those techniques, but the point is governance: audited pipelines with clear ownership and safe failure modes.

### Is this just a bunch of Zaps?
No. No-code is a tool. Operational liquidity is the goal. When reliability and auditability matter, we build custom pipelines.

# AI INTEGRATION <br/>SERVICES

Custom Gateways for Sovereign Data.
Our AI integration services connect large language models and AI tools into your existing ERP, CRM, and internal systems without replacing your infrastructure.
We provide AI system integration services and generative AI integration services for enterprises that require governance and data sovereignty. We can deliver AI integration consulting services or build the integration layer end-to-end, with visibility, controls, and safe failure modes.
Teams hire us for AI integration services for businesses under different labels: gen AI integration services, AI tool integration services, integration services for AI tools, or AI agent integration services. The name doesn’t matter. Ownership, auditability, and safe failure modes do.
No replatforming. No shadow AI. No brittle “glue code.”
### Support Line

Available as a standalone build or a managed service (host & maintain).
Request an Infrastructure Audit

Book a Meeting

## The Gateway Philosophy

Most integration proposals quietly lock you into proprietary middleware. We build integration layers that guarantee sovereignty without lock-in.
### You own the logic
The integration layer is built around your workflows and policies.

### You choose the operating model
Host it yourself, or we run it for you under a retainer.

### Model agility
Switch providers (or move to self-hosted) without rewriting the workflow.

## Bring the AI to the Data

For sensitive workloads, we don’t force “data export as a strategy.”
### VPC-First

Deployed inside your private cloud environment where possible.
### On-Prem Ready

Air-gapped or local deployment support where required.
### Vendor Controls

Strict allowlists and data residency constraints respected.
## Enterprise-Grade Rigor

### Idempotency
One event equals one action. No double-triggering or accidental reprocessing.

### Retries + Rate Limits
Safe retry behavior that doesn’t turn provider outages into internal incidents.

### RBAC / Least Privilege
The model only sees what the workflow owner is authorized to access.

### Deterministic Fallbacks
If a model fails, the system enters a safe path and alerts a human.

### Rollback Paths
Controlled releases and reversible changes for every deployment.

## The Integration Matrix

Designed for change. Options depend on your security policies and constraints.
Capability

What it enables

Mission

## Integrations Shouldn’t Be a Black Box

We turn “shadow AI” into boring infrastructure. We replace silent corruption and API anxiety with visible tickets and safe, human-led overrides.
### State Tracking
Pending / success / failed states visible in your dashboard.

### Alerts + Overrides
Clear escalation when a step fails or confidence is low.

### Token & Cost Monitoring
Cost-per-task visibility so finance doesn’t get surprised.

### Audit Logs
Every decision, model call, tool call, and write is traceable.

## The Hard No

No interface, no integration. If your system has no workable API, database connection, webhook, or export path, we can’t build a governed bridge.
#### We also won’t build:

- “Black box” automations where we can’t baseline outcomes
- Production workflows with ungoverned model autonomy for writes
## FAQ

### Do we own the gateway code?
Yes. This is not a SaaS connector. You own the integration layer we build.

### How do you prevent data leakage to proprietary models?
We scope to your constraints. For sensitive workloads, we can avoid public APIs and deploy within your VPC or on-prem using approved models and controls.

### Is this for chatbots?
This is for objective-driven systems. Chat is an interface. The gateway is infrastructure that makes AI usable inside governed workflows.

### How do we start?
Start with an Infrastructure Audit to map your data surface, APIs, and policy constraints. If the wedge is clear, we scope the build (or recommend the Sprint first).

See Work / Results

## Who It&apos;s For

If you just need an open-ended chatbot, ChatGPT already exists. This is for teams that need governance and clear ownership.

## Why Most Fail

### No Defined Objective
So nobody owns success.

### No RBAC/ABAC
Everyone can see everything.

### No Traceability
No one can explain what happened.

### Blind Retrieval
Context injection without boundaries.

### No Adoption Model
Middle management rejects it.

Governed by Default

## What “Enterprise” Means to Us

Governance is not optional. An employee should not be able to query executive compensation or access HR salary bands.
### RBAC / ABAC
Least-privilege access to data and tools.

### Tool Boundaries
Deterministic tool usage (no blind execution).

### Citations
Traceable answers with source references.

### Audit Logs
Queries, sources, actions, and outputs logged.

### Escalation Paths
Human review for high-risk actions.

### Monitoring
Evaluation and drift detection over time.

### Valid Objectives

- Reduce support resolution time by routing and drafting responses
- Improve knowledge lookup for SOPs (with access controls)
- Fetch open tickets aligned to documented procedures
- Provide governed multilingual support
- Display structured data cross-referenced against rules

### Adoption Reality

Chatbots are rejected by teams who fear redundancy or distrust the data. Adoption requires accuracy, governance, and usefulness inside workflow.
#### Multilingual Deployment

English

Cantonese

Mandarin

Bahasa

Language is identity. Governed AI should respect that.
## No Forced Lock-In

We don’t force subscription dependency. Depending on your constraints, you can host inside your VPC, use approved providers, or keep cost visibility.
#### Host Yourself

VPC or on-prem where required.
#### Approved Models

Use providers you already trust.
#### Cost Visibility

Cost-per-task, not mystery bills.
## FAQ

### Do you build custom chatbot systems or configure tools?
Both. Tool choice is secondary. Governance and adoption are primary.

### Can it connect to our documents and systems?
Yes, with permissioned access, logging, and controlled tool boundaries.

### What about hallucinations?
We reduce risk through architecture, not hope: deterministic tool calls, structured outputs, citations, limited context injection, and escalation paths.

### What makes you different from SaaS chatbot vendors?
We deploy inside your existing systems, enforce governance, tie the bot to defined objectives, and avoid open-ended experimentation.

### How do we start?
Start with a Sprint if you want a governed pilot in 30 days, or begin with a Fit Audit to define objective + access boundaries.

## Who This Is For

This is for leadership teams who want AI revenue without AI chaos. If you need a demo, start with a Sprint. If you need production discipline, start here.

## Engineering Discipline Applied to AI

This is not generic AI software development services or AI development services. We engineer the layer that makes AI safe, profitable, and maintainable.
### Beyond Works &quot;Sometimes&quot;

For teams that need reliability and uptime, not just a cool demo.
### Cost Control

Architected to keep margins healthy as you scale user count.
### Change Management

Pass security reviews without slowing delivery to zero.
The Standard

## Prompts as Code

We don’t treat prompts as “messages” or “settings.” Prompts are code. Outcome: prompt updates stop being a gamble.
- Version Control Prompts and configs are versioned in Git like core infrastructure.
- Deterministic Evaluation Evaluation harnesses with golden datasets to prevent regressions. No subjective &quot;looks good&quot;.
- Release Discipline Prompt/model changes ship behind flags, with rollback paths.

Updates, writes, and database alterations are never “guessed” by AI.

Hard Boundaries

## The Anti-Havoc Backend

Unrestricted AI code generation is the quickest path to unmaintainable spaghetti. We enforce hard boundaries.
#### No Silent Writes

AI does not alter databases or execute decisions without checks.
#### Least Privilege

Tool access is scoped to the workflow, not “whatever the model wants.”
#### Auditability

Every model call, tool call, and state transition is logged.
## Telemetry That Protects Margins

If you can’t tie token spend to a measured business outcome, it isn’t a strategy. It’s a cost center.
### Usage Attribution
Cost per task, customer, or workflow.

### Telemetry ROI
Tie spend to hours reclaimed and SLA lift.

### Chat Recreation
Replay real interactions to fix failure modes.

### Model Routing
Optimize model selection to control spend.

## What We Build

### Microservices & APIs

For AI-native features like RAG, extraction, drafting, and triage.
### Eval Harnesses

Golden datasets and regression gates to ensure massive reliability.
### Observability Stack

Logs, traces, cost monitoring, and dashboards.
### Guardrails

Policy boundaries, approvals, fallbacks, and safe rollout patterns (feature flags).
## Why This vs. A &quot;Full Stack&quot; Shop

Generalist shops build &quot;AI features&quot;. We engineer the layer that makes AI safe, profitable, and maintainable.
The Difference is the Plumbing
Idempotency

Regression Control

Token Discipline

## FAQ

### How do you prevent spaghetti code?
By refusing to use unrestricted AI for code execution. We plan the architecture first. AI is a bridge for unstructured data, not the architect of your system.

### Is it really stack-agnostic?
Yes. We build microservices that plug in. If we can speak to your systems via API or database, we can build the AI-native layer you need.

### What is “chat recreation”?
The ability to replay a specific interaction inside the evaluation harness to see exactly where a model failed, then version and fix the prompt/model behavior permanently.

### Do you also do classic ML?
Yes, when it’s the right tool. “AI/ML development services” should be chosen by problem fit, not hype.

### Do you build agents?
Only with approvals, bounded actions, and hard safety boundaries. No open-ended autonomy for writes.

### What’s the best first step?
Request a Technical Audit. If scope is unclear or risk is high, start with the Sprint to validate impact safely.
